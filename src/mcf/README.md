Model design

A model is a directory with the following layout:

```
<model-name>
|
+-- entities/
|   // Here are all entities
|
+-- relations/
|   // Here are all relations between entities
|
+-- actions/
|   // Here are all actions on each relation
|
+-- constraints/
|   // Here are all constraints for each entity
|
+-- model.cfg
    // Main model description
```
