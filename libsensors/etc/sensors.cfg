# Conditions:
#
# 1. If sensors are defined, local version runs forever
#    Use --daemon to "sysinspect" to go background in local mode.
#
# 2. It is up to luser define what to do on the events. Sensors only
#    emit the data in JSON to the event handler and nothing else.
#
# 3. Sensors are not a part of any model. It is the listening configuration
#    of a Sysinspect agent (SysMinion or Sysinspect local mode). Their purpose
#    is merely scream if stuff happens. What to do, what model to call (or not)
#    is all up to luser.
#
# 4. Events must be removed from the model itself, because they are always the same
#    anyways and must be part of sensors now.

# SYNOPSIS
# sensors:
#   interval:
#     max: 10
#     min: 3
#     unit: seconds|minutes|hours
#
#   <id>:
#     profile:
#       - <profile1>
#       - <profile2>
#     description: <description of the sensor>
#     listener: <listener type>
#     opts:
#       - <option1>
#       - <option2>
#     args:
#       key: <value>
#
#     event: <event ID to emit on trigger, optional>

sensors:
  # If interval is not specified in the sensor explicitly,
  # A random one within this range will be selected
  interval:
    max: 10
    min: 3
    unit: seconds

  # A random ID
  ssh-config-sensor:
    # Default if not defined at all
    profile:
      - default

    description: Watches SSH config
    listener: file
    opts:
      - changed
      - deleted
    args:
      interval: 5
      unit: second

      # Listener-specific arg
      path: /etc/ssh/ssh_conf

    # Emits a specific event Id that will be captured by the event handler
    event: foo/bar/baz/dang/0

  pid-watch:
    profile:
      - system
      - default
    description: If a particular process appears
    listener: process
    opts:
      - appeared
    args:
      interval: 5
      unit: second

      # Listener-specific arg
      process: vivaldi-bin

    # If event is not explicitly overridden, then default event ID is used
    # in the following format:
    #
    #     event: listener/id/process:[opts]/0
    #
    # In this particular case it will be the following:
    #
    #     event: process/pid-watch/vivaldi-bin:appeared/0
    #
    # To capture that — one must be setting up corresponding event handler
    # what to do on that event.
