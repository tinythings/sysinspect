# sysclient

Auto-generated SDK client using openapi generator. To re-generate the SDK, simply start
current version of the `sysmaster` locally with API server enabled, and then just run this:

	make <ENTER>

That's all. It will download OpenAPI spec, validate it and then generate you SDK for Rust
into `sysinslect-client` sub-directory.

## Usage & Docs

[Re]Generate the client, and then navigate to the `html-docs` directory and open any HTML
file with your web browser.

See a practical example in `src/main.rs` how to use the client.
