# Sysinspect

Sysinspect is an engine of Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis.
This engine is indented to perform anomaly detection and root cause analysis on any system.
It is using Model Description as a source of knowledge and a collection of modules with telemetry data in order to perform various testing scenarios.

## Use Case

Primarily this is an experimental work for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

## Bonus Use Case

Configuration management. As Sysinspect can get the information, it also can set the information. It is a matter of modules.
This workflow works very similar to Ansible style.
