## `sys.meminfo` module

This is a simple module to fetch the memory information from a Linux device.

## Building

Gnu Make is required. Then:

1. `make setup`
2. `make`

You should end up with a dynamic binary for your current platform in `bin/<target>/meminfo`.
For more options: `make <TAB><TAB>`...
