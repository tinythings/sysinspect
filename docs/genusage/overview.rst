Using Sysinspect
================

.. note::

    This section explains how to use Sysinspect in "solo" mode and
    in the network.


Sysinspect can be used in two modes:

1. Solo mode, where the entire model is for only one "box" or hardware
2. Network-connected cluster, where entities can consist from more than one element
   and Sysinspect needs to gather information from different places in order to construct
   a final answer about a specific entity. Such entity, for example, can be the entire
   network itself.


To better understand how to use Sysinspect in those situation, read through the following
