Web API
=======

This section provides an overview of the Web API for SysInspect, including its structure, endpoints, and usage.

Accessing the Documentation
---------------------------

The Web API is automatically documented using Swagger, which provides a user-friendly interface to explore the available endpoints
and their parameters. You can access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

```
http://<your-server-address>:4202/api-doc/
```

This interface, running on default port **4202**, allows you to interact with the API, view the available endpoints,
and test them directly from your browser. You can change the port and API version in the general ``sysinspect.conf``
configuration file.
