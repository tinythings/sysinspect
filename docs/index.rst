Welcome to Syspect: an engine of Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis.
The name consists of two words "system" and "inspection", resulting in "suspicion".

This engine is indented to perform anomaly detection and root cause analysis on
any system. It is using Model Description as a source of knowledge and a collection of
modules with telemetry data in order to perform various testing scenarios.
