  This module allows executing Lua scripts as modules within
  the SysInspect framework. Lua scripts should be placed
  in the configured scripts directory and can be called by
  specifying their name.

  The module supports passing additional arguments to the Lua
  script, which will be available as global variables within
  the script.

  Important to keep the following directory structure for your
  Lua scripts and their dependencies:

  1. The [W::b]main Lua scripts[N] (modules) for this runtime must be installed
  in [y::]${SYSINSPECT_SHARELIB_ROOT}[Y::]/lib/runtime/lua54/[N] directory,

  2. The [W::b]dependency libraries[N] for these scripts should be placed in the
  [y::]${SYSINSPECT_SHARELIB_ROOT}[Y::]/lib/runtime/lua54/site-lua/[N] directory.
